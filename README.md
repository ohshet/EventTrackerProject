###REST API Project###
This project is a simple REST API that allows a user to store, retrieve, and modify information about their last gasoline fill up.  It performs create, read, udpate and delete (CRUD) operations on mySQL database named fuel.  The fill up table contains columns for an auto-incremented ID, date, odometer reading, gallons, and price per gallon.  The user may search the database by ID, or by ranges (min - max) of dates, odometer entries, prices, or gallons.  This information may be used to track a vehicle's fuel efficiency or the price of fuel across time.
